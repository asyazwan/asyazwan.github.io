I've always wanted to write. But every time, I will stop midway and eventually lose momentum. Rinse and repeat.

I know exactly what the problem is and I always knew the answer of what to do.

## The problem

For the longest time I have this obsession of perfection in everything I do, especially something that is for the public to see such as a blog.
Of course it's never perfect and I will be stuck thinking over how to improve and over time lose interest altogether.
If this sounds familiar, yes -- it's called [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) and is something notorious among IT developers.
Hence the mantra of "Ship it" to publish products that are in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state and work on _completing_ it as the userbase grows (which is also a metric somewhat to validate your prototype).


## The fix

So I've identified the problem. But unsurprisingly, the solution is pretty obvious:
There really is no other way to fix this problem other than Just Do It.
Just post, who cares. Make a comment section. If somebody cares enough they will leave a comment to compliment, criticize or correct me.

Dedicate some time to write a draft. Make sure the draft doesn't stay a draft in a week. Then publish whatever I have.
Hopefully I can stay true to this method. We'll see. :)


Oh and Hello, world!
